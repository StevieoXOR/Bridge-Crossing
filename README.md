# Bridge-Crossing
Simulates a 1-way bridge that can support 1 semi-truck or up to 3 cars using C pthreads.

Program will create Segmentation Faults due to Memory Leaks. Also, it may occasionally get stuck (I may have fixed that issue, but I don't know for sure). However, the program seems to mostly work.
